These are some projects that i have done as a first year undergraduate in college.
In the workbook exercises folder the projects are based on the book "The Python Workbook by Ben Stephenson"
In the folder named "Chatgpt" i have used chatgpt to generate leetcode style questions to match my knowledge level.
